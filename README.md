## 💡 Why Technical Writing Matters

Technical writing bridges the gap between developers, users, and stakeholders. Well-written documentation:

- Makes software easier to understand and use
- Improves onboarding for new team members
- Reduces technical debt
- Enhances communication across cross-functional teams

## 📄 Key Documents in Software Projects

Here are common types of technical documents in a software lifecycle:

| Document Type        | Purpose                                                  |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| README.md            | Overview and usage of a project                           |
| API Documentation    | How to interact with the system via code (REST, GraphQL) |
| Software Requirements Spec (SRS) | Detailed description of system features and constraints |
| User Manual          | Instructions for non-technical users                      |
| Developer Guide      | Instructions and architecture details for developers      |
| Changelog            | Tracks version updates and bug fixes                      |

## ✅ Best Practices

- **Use clear, concise language**
- **Organize content with headings, lists, and tables**
- **Include examples and code snippets**
- **Update documents regularly**
- **Follow a consistent style guide** (e.g., Google Developer Documentation Style Guide)

## 🧰 Sample Templates

Check the `/templates` folder for:

- `README_template.md`
- `API_documentation_template.md`
- `User_guide_template.md`
- `Developer_guide_template.md`

Each template is pre-formatted in Markdown and ready for customization.
